### Project Overview
I am provided with visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools I must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

### Purpose
This project displays JavaScriptâ€™s object oriented programming features with eloquently designed classes capable of creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects. It also displays use of inheritance and delegation used to create well architected and performant applications.
